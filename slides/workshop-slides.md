## Introduction to Generative AI

### What is Generative AI?

- Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content.
- It can generate text, images, music, and more based on the data it has been trained on.

---

## How Does Generative AI Work?

### Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: Generative AI models are trained on large datasets.
- **Neural Networks**: These models use neural networks to learn patterns and structures in the data.
- **Generation**: Once trained, the model can generate new content that mimics the training data.

## Applications Using AI API

### Examples of AI API Integration

- **Grammarly**: Uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide grammar and style suggestions.
- **Duolingo**: Employs AI to adapt language lessons based on the user's progress.
- **Khan Academy**: Chatbot tutoring system that helps students with math problems.
- **GitHub Copilot**: An AI-powered code completion tool that assists developers by generating code snippets.

## Tech Stack Overview

For this workshop, we'll be using a modern tech stack to build the Creator PRO application. This stack includes:

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It's known for its performance and ease of use.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing better tooling and error checking.

---

### Backend

- **Next.js API Routes**: We'll use Next.js API routes to handle backend logic, making it easy to create full-stack applications within the same framework.

### AI Integration

- **Gemini API**: Our primary AI service for text generation and audio transcription. It provides advanced capabilities to enhance our application's features.

---

## Introduction to Creator PRO

Creator PRO is a powerful tool designed for content creators, offering features for script creation and audio transcription using advanced AI models.

---

## Features Overview

- **Script Creation**: Easily create and manage scripts for your content.
- **Audio Transcription**: Upload audio files and get accurate transcriptions in Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian Language).

---

## The Importance of Prompting

### Effective Prompt Design

- Clarity: Clearly define what you want the AI to do.
- Specificity: The more specific the prompt, the better the result.
- Context: Provide enough context to guide the AI in generating relevant content.

---

### Solving User Problems with Effective Prompting

- Understanding User Needs: Tailor prompts to address specific content needs, such as educational videos, marketing scripts, or entertainment.
- Iterative Refinement: Use feedback loops to refine prompts and improve output quality over time.

---

## Conclusion

- Recap: Today, we explored the basics of Creator PRO, focusing on script creation and audio transcription using the Gemini API.
- Next Steps: Continue to experiment with the Gemini API and refine your application features.
